# Customer Churn

Customer churn is defined as customers that left in the last month, and can be due to several reasons like finding a better deal at a different company. In order to reduce churn and retain as many customers as possible, companies must predict which customers are likely to leave and increase their satisfaction with the product. By using customer information like demographics, deal type, and history, we can create a model to learn patterns in customer churn.

The data comes from the Kaggle dataset here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data

Run the project in customer_churn.ipynb to see the model and the results.
